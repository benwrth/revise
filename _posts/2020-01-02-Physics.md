## Forces

### Scalar and vectors

* A __scalar__ only has a size, like speed.
* A __vector__ has both a size and a direction, like velocity.
    * Arrows can be used to represent vectors, with the length showing the size and pointing in the direction of the force.
    * __Forces__ are vectors as they have both a magnitude and a direction.

### Contact and non-contact forces

* __Contact Forces__ - when the objects touch, like tension if you were pulling on something.
    * More examples include:
        * Friction
        * Air resistance
        * Tension
* __Non-contact forces__ - When the objects are __not__ touching, like the force of gravity.
    * More examples include:
        * Gravitational force
        * Electrostatic force
        * Magnetic force

### Gravity

* A force of attraction between all masses.
* Caused by a gravitational field around the planet.
* The __mass__ of an object is related to the amount of matter it contains - so it is constant.
* However, the __weight__ of an object is the force acting on an object due to gravity.
    * Dependent on the gravitational field strength and directly proportional to mass.
    * __weight = mass x gravitational field strength__

### Resultant Forces

When multiple forces act on one object, they can all be seen as a single force that is equivalent to all the forces acting together.

### Vector Diagrams (Higher)

* A [__free body diagram__](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zpwhrwx/revision/3) can be used to show different forces acting on an object.
