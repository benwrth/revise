## Power and Conflict Poetry

### Ozymandias

>*I met a traveller from an antique land*  
*Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone*  
*Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,*  
*Half sunk, a shatter’d visage lies, whose frown*  
*And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command*  
*Tell that its sculptor well those passions read*  
*Which yet survive, stamp’d on these lifeless things,*  
*The hand that mock’d them and the heart that fed;*  
*And on the pedestal these words appear:*  
*‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:*  
*Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’*  
*Nothing beside remains. Round the decay*  
*Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,*  
*The lone and level sands stretch far away.*

#### Context  

* Based on Ramases II
  * Inscription on his tomb describes him as *king of kings*
  * Ordered a statue to be built
    * Used slave labour to build them
* Ramases wanted to build memorials which would last forever.
* The poem is about a statue of ex-leader Ozymandias crumbling in a bad state of repair, juxtaposing to his idea of lasting forever in the form of a statue.

#### Annotations

>*I met a traveller from an antique land*

Being said by the narrator, *'antique land'* suggests they haven't even heard of Ozymandias.  

>*Trunkless legs of stone*

This tells the reader the statue has crumbled

>*Stand in the desert.*

Lifeless - Time and nature has more power than the human race.  
Empty, vast and vauge.

>*My name is Ozymandias, king of kings*

Shoes the reader that Ozymandias is arrogant - he only wants power and is willing to exploit people to get more.

>*Look on my words, ye mighty, and despair!*

*'look'* and *'despair'* are both imperative verbs that are instructing others to admire him, showing he is hungry for more power and attention.

>*The lone and level sands strech far away*

Alliteration that emphasises the vastness of a desert.

### London

>*I wander through each chartered street,*  
*Near where the chartered Thames does flow,*  
*And mark in every face I meet*  
*Marks of weakness, marks of woe.*

>*In every cry of every man,*  
*In every infant’s cry of fear,*  
*In every voice, in every ban,*  
*The mind-forged manacles I hear:*

>*How the chimney-sweeper’s cry*  
*Every black’ning church appalls,*  
*And the hapless soldier’s sigh*  
*Runs in blood down palace walls.*

>*But most through midnight streets I hear*  
*How the youthful harlot’s curse*  
*Blasts the new-born infant’s tear,*  
*And blights with plagues the marriage hearse.*  

#### Context
* Blake lost faith in religion after he found the church to be very hypocritical.
* Industrial revolution is taking place in England and the French revolution is happening in France.
* Poem depicits the backstreets and the poorer side of London.
  * Whilst the city was a growing metropolis, it also has a large dark side.
* Many STIs being spread by prostitutes and many dying.

#### Annotations
>*I wander through each **chartered** street,*  
*Near where the **chartered** Thames does flow,*  

*'I wander'*: Walking slowly, without purpouse.  
The repetition of chartered shows everything is controlled.

>*And mark in every face I meet*
*Marks of weakness, marks of woe.*  

Everyone he meets looks distressed, emphasising the scale of London's problem.

>_**In every** cry of every man,_  
_**In every** infant’s cry of fear,_  
_**In every voice**, in every ban,_   

Repetition, showing poetry is all consuming.  
*'Ban'* reffering to Government rules and laws.

>*How the chimney-sweeper's cry^1*  



### The Prelude

>*One summer evening (led by her) I found*  
*A little boat tied to a willow tree*  
*Within a rocky cove, its usual home.*  
*Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in*  
*Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth*  
*And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice*  
*Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;*  
*Leaving behind her still, on either side,*  
*Small circles glittering idly in the moon,*  
*Until they melted all into one track*  
*Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,*  
*Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point*  
*With an unswerving line, I fixed my view*  
*Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,*  
*The horizon’s utmost boundary; far above*  
*Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.*  
*She was an elfin pinnace; lustily*  
*I dipped my oars into the silent lake,*  
*And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat*  
*Went heaving through the water like a swan;*  
*When, from behind that craggy steep till then*  
*The horizon’s bound, a huge peak, black and huge,*  
*As if with voluntary power instinct,*  
*Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,*  
*And growing still in stature the grim shape*  
*Towered up between me and the stars, and still,*  
*For so it seemed, with purpose of its own*  
*And measured motion like a living thing,*  
*Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,*  
*And through the silent water stole my way*  
*Back to the covert of the willow tree;*  
*There in her mooring-place I left my bark, –*  
*And through the meadows homeward went, in grave*  
*And serious mood; but after I had seen*  
*That spectacle, for many days, my brain*  
*Worked with a dim and undetermined sense*  
*Of unknown modes of being; o’er my thoughts*  
*There hung a darkness, call it solitude*  
*Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes*  
*Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes*  
*Remained, no pleasant images of trees,*  
*Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;*  
*But huge and mighty forms, that do not live*  
*Like living men, moved slowly through the mind*  
*By day, and were a trouble to my dreams.*
