## Power and Conflict Poetry

### Ozymandias

>*I met a traveller from an antique land*  
*Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone*  
*Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,*  
*Half sunk, a shatter’d visage lies, whose frown*  
*And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command*  
*Tell that its sculptor well those passions read*  
*Which yet survive, stamp’d on these lifeless things,*  
*The hand that mock’d them and the heart that fed;*  
*And on the pedestal these words appear:*  
*‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:*  
*Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’*  
*Nothing beside remains. Round the decay*  
*Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,*  
*The lone and level sands stretch far away.*

#### Context  

* Based on Ramses II
  * Inscription on his tomb describes him as *king of kings*
  * Ordered a statue to be built
    * Used slave labour to build them
* Ramses wanted to build memorials which would last forever.
* The poem is about a statue of ex-leader Ozymandias crumbling in a bad state of repair, juxtaposing to his idea of lasting forever in the form of a statue.

#### Annotations

>*I met a traveller from an **antique land***

Being said by the narrator, *'antique land'* suggests they haven't even heard of Ozymandias.  

>*Who said: Two vast and **Trunkless legs of stone***

This informs the reader the statue has crumbled

>***Stand in the desert.*** *Near them on the sand,*

Lifeless - Time and nature has more power than the human race.  
Empty, vast and vague.

>***My name is Ozymandias, king of kings***

Shows the reader that Ozymandias is arrogant - he only wants power and is willing to exploit people to get more.

>***Look*** *on my words, ye mighty, and **despair!***

*'look'* and *'despair'* are both imperative verbs that are instructing others to admire him, showing he is hungry for more power and attention.

>*The **lone and level** sands stretch far away*

Alliteration that emphasizes the vastness of a desert.

### London

>*I wander through each chartered street,*  
*Near where the chartered Thames does flow,*  
*And mark in every face I meet*  
*Marks of weakness, marks of woe.*

>*In every cry of every man,*  
*In every infant’s cry of fear,*  
*In every voice, in every ban,*  
*The mind-forged manacles I hear:*

>*How the chimney-sweeper’s cry*  
*Every black’ning church appalls,*  
*And the hapless soldier’s sigh*  
*Runs in blood down palace walls.*

>*But most through midnight streets I hear*  
*How the youthful harlot’s curse*  
*Blasts the new-born infant’s tear,*  
*And blights with plagues the marriage hearse.*  

#### Context
* Blake lost faith in religion after he found the church to be very hypocritical.
  * He noticed the church refused to help those most in need while preaching to help others.
* Industrial revolution is taking place in England and the French revolution is happening in France - many of the poorer people are going against the aristocracy (rich and royal).
* Poem depicts the backstreets and the poorer side of London.
  * Whilst the city was a growing metropolis, it also has a large dark side.
* Many STIs being spread by prostitutes and many dying.

#### Annotations
>***I wander*** *through each **chartered** street,*  
*Near where the **chartered** Thames does flow,*  

*'I wander'* - Walking slowly, without purpose.  
The repetition of chartered shows everything is laid out and controlled.

>***And mark in every face I meet***  
***Marks of weakness, marks of woe.***  

Everyone he meets looks distressed, emphasising the scale of London's problem.

>***In every*** *cry of every man,*  
***In every*** *infant’s cry of fear,*  
***In every*** *voice, in every **ban**,*   

Repetition, showing poverty is all consuming.  
*'Ban'* reffering to Government rules and laws.

>*How the **chimney-sweeper's** cry*  
*Every **black’ning church** appalls,*  
*And the hapless soldier’s sigh*  

Suggests everybody is fed up and distressed.  
*'chimney sweeper'* Is referencing child labour.
*'black'ning church'* Represents the corruption in the church, who refused to help those suffering in the most need.  

>*Runs in **blood down palace** walls.*  

Metaphor - palace made with suffering of the poor.

>*But most through **midnight streets** I hear*  

The dark side of London.

>*How the **youthful Harlot's curse***  

They feel sympathy on the unfortunate situation of the prostitutes.

>*Blast the **new-born infant's tear***  

Children born into a life of poverty.

### The Prelude

>*One summer evening (led by her) I found*  
*A little boat tied to a willow tree*  
*Within a rocky cove, its usual home.*  
*Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in*  
*Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth*  
*And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice*  
*Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;*  
*Leaving behind her still, on either side,*  
*Small circles glittering idly in the moon,*  
*Until they melted all into one track*  
*Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,*  
*Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point*  
*With an unswerving line, I fixed my view*  
*Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,*  
*The horizon’s utmost boundary; far above*  
*Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.*  
*She was an elfin pinnace; lustily*  
*I dipped my oars into the silent lake,*  
*And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat*  
*Went heaving through the water like a swan;*  
*When, from behind that craggy steep till then*  
*The horizon’s bound, a huge peak, black and huge,*  
*As if with voluntary power instinct,*  
*Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,*  
*And growing still in stature the grim shape*  
*Towered up between me and the stars, and still,*  
*For so it seemed, with purpose of its own*  
*And measured motion like a living thing,*  
*Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,*  
*And through the silent water stole my way*  
*Back to the covert of the willow tree;*  
*There in her mooring-place I left my bark, –*  
*And through the meadows homeward went, in grave*  
*And serious mood; but after I had seen*  
*That spectacle, for many days, my brain*  
*Worked with a dim and undetermined sense*  
*Of unknown modes of being; o’er my thoughts*  
*There hung a darkness, call it solitude*  
*Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes*  
*Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes*  
*Remained, no pleasant images of trees,*  
*Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;*  
*But huge and mighty forms, that do not live*  
*Like living men, moved slowly through the mind*  
*By day, and were a trouble to my dreams.*  

#### Context
* Wordsworth lived an unhappy childhood, influencing his poetry.
  * Much of it discusses the power of nature and the relationship man has with it.
* Believes nature is much more powerful than man.

#### Annotations

>*One summer evening **led by her** I found*

Personification of nature - *'led by'* shows nature is in charge.

>*Pushed from shore. It was an **act of stealth***

They had confidence in what they were doing

>*And **troubled pleasure**, nor without the voice*

They feel excited yet have guilt.

>***Small circles glittering idly in the moon,***  
***Until they melted all into one track***  
***Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,***  

Vivid description of the area around them.

>***Proud of his skill**, to reach a chosen point*

Shows the confidence and arrogance of man.

>***She was an elfin pinnace**; lustily*

He loves the 'ship' he is sailing. Shows arrogance.

>*I dipped my oars into the **silent lake,***

Believes nature isn't powerful.

>*And, as I rose upon the stroke, **my boat***

Takes what he wants and claims it as his.

>*Went heaving through the water **like a swan;***

Simile - graceful and in control.

>***When**, from behind that craggy steep till then*

Volta - turning point in the poem.

>*The horizon’s bound, a **huge peak, black and huge,***

Repetition.
Sees the mountain as threatening/menacing.  
Realises he was wrong, and that nature is more powerful than him.

>***Upreared its head**. I struck and struck again,*

Threatening the boy.

>*And **growing still in stature** the grim shape*  
***Towered up between me** and the stars, and still,*

Feels like it is chasing him and getting closer.  
Feeling guilty.

>***Strode after me.** With **trembling oars** I turned,*

Chasing him like it is a simple walk.  
Boy is terrified about the experience.

>*There in her mooring-place I left my bark, –*

He has realised the power nature holds and has returned the boat in total shame and guilt.

>*And through the meadows homeward went, **in grave***

The tone has shifted - rather disturbed.

>***That spectacle, for many days, my brain***

The experience haunts him for days

>***Of unknown modes of being**; o’er my thoughts*

Realises he doesn't know everything

>_**There hung a darkness**, call it **solitude**_

Its scary not knowing things.  
He feels lonely.

>*Remained, **no pleasant images** of trees,*

He has forgotten the beauty of nature.

>*By day, and were a **trouble to my dreams.***

Haunted by that moment

### My Last Duchess

>Ferarra  
*That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,*  
*Looking as if she were alive. I call*  
*That piece a wonder, now: Frà Pandolf’s hands*  
*Worked busily a day, and there she stands.*  
*Will’t please you sit and look at her? I said*  
*‘Frà Pandolf’ by design, for never read*  
*Strangers like you that pictured countenance,*  
*The depth and passion of its earnest glance,*  
*But to myself they turned (since none puts by*  
*The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)*  
*And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,*  
*How such a glance came there; so, not the first*  
*Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not*  
*Her husband’s presence only, called that spot*  
*Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek: perhaps*  
*Frà Pandolf chanced to say ‘Her mantle laps*  
*Over my lady’s wrist too much,’ or ‘Paint*  
*Must never hope to reproduce the faint*  
*Half-flush that dies along her throat’: such stuff*  
*Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough*  
*For calling up that spot of joy. She had*  
*A heart – how shall I say? – too soon made glad,*  
*Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er*  
*She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.*  
*Sir, ’twas all one! My favour at her breast,*  
*The dropping of the daylight in the West,*  
*The bough of cherries some officious fool*  
*Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule*  
*She rode with round the terrace – all and each*  
*Would draw from her alike the approving speech,*  
*Or blush, at least. She thanked men, – good! but thanked*  
*Somehow – I know not how – as if she ranked*  
*My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name*  
*With anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame*  
*This sort of trifling? Even had you skill*  
*In speech – (which I have not) – to make your will*  
*Quite clear to such an one, and say, ‘Just this*  
*Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,*  
*Or there exceed the mark’ – and if she let*  
*Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set*  
*Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,*  
*– E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose*  
*Never to stoop. Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,*  
*Whene’er I passed her; but who passed without*  
*Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;*  
*Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands*  
*As if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet*  
*The company below, then. I repeat,*  
*The Count your master’s known munificence*  
*Is ample warrant that no just pretence*  
*Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;*  
*Though his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed*  
*At starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go*  
*Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,*  
*Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,*  
*Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!*  

#### Context
* Dukes/Duchesses are usually born or married into the role.
  * They are higher up than everything other than princes/princesses and kings/queens.
* Set and written during a time when women had near to no power.
* Poem is a criticism on how women are treated in society.
* Based on fictional characters however some have speculated it refers to certain historical characters.

#### Annotations

>***Ferrara***

Establishing where the poem is set

>*That’s **my last Duchess** painted on the wall,*

Possessive pronoun could suggests he 'owned' the painting and the woman herself.

>***Looking as if she were alive.** I call*

Sets a sinister tome - hints at her death.

>***Will’t please you sit and look at her? I said***

Politely ordering to admire the painting.  
Constant use of the personal pronoun 'I' shows the man is narcissistic.

>***The curtain I have drawn for you**, but I)*

Sinister.  
The curtain is metaphorical of his control - he is in charge of hiding her away or 'showing her off' to guests.

>*And seemed as they would ask me, **if they durst,***

*'If they dared'* - suggests people were afraid of his volatile temper.

>*Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not*

Enjambment - could suggest he like talking about himself/egotistical?

>***Half-flush that dies along her throat’**: such stuff*

Reference to duchess' death - strangulation.  
Hints at duchess' fate - foreshadowing.

>*Or blush, at least. **She thanked men, – good!** but thanked*

He stammers, which could suggest he is worried and *'good!'* suggests he is jealous because she treated everyone similarly to the way she treated him.

>***Somehow – I know not how – as if she ranked***  
***My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name***  
***With anybody’s gift.** Who’d stoop to blame*

Believes her to very ungrateful as he didn't get a different response when she was 'gifted' his name in marriage. He believed his wife should only blush at him.

>*Whene’er **I** passed her; but who passed without*  
*Much the same smile? This grew; **I** gave commands;*  
***Then all smiles stopped together.** There she stands*  
*As if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet*  
*The company below, then. **I** repeat,*

Repetition of I suggests he is self-obsessed. He can't stop going on about himself.  
*Then all smiles stopped together.* - Duke ordered for her to be killed.

>***Taming a sea-horse,** thought a rarity,*

Dehumanising his wife.  
Tried to 'tame' her, which failed.

### Charge of the Light Brigade

>*Half a league, half a league,*  
*Half a league onward,*  
*All in the valley of Death*  
*‎‎    ‎Rode the six hundred.*  
*‘Forward, the Light Brigade!*  
*Charge for the guns!’ he said:*  
*Into the valley of Death*  
*‎‎    ‎Rode the six hundred.*    
*‎‎*  
*‘Forward, the Light Brigade!’*  
*Was there a man dismay’d?*  
*Not tho’ the soldier knew*  
*‎    Some one had blunder’d:*  
*Theirs not to make reply,*  
*Theirs not to reason why,*  
*Theirs but to do and die:*  
*Into the valley of Death*  
*‎‎‎    Rode the six hundred.*
