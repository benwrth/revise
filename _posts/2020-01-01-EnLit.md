## Power and Conflict Poetry

### Ozymandaias

>*I met a traveller from an antique land*  
*Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone*  
*Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,*  
*Half sunk, a shatter’d visage lies, whose frown*  
*And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command*  
*Tell that its sculptor well those passions read*  
*Which yet survive, stamp’d on these lifeless things,*  
*The hand that mock’d them and the heart that fed;*  
*And on the pedestal these words appear:*  
*‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:*  
*Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’*  
*Nothing beside remains. Round the decay*  
*Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,*  
*The lone and level sands stretch far away.*

### London

>*I wander through each chartered street,*  
*Near where the chartered Thames does flow,*  
*And mark in every face I meet*  
*Marks of weakness, marks of woe.*

>*In every cry of every man,*  
*In every infant’s cry of fear,*  
*In every voice, in every ban,*  
*The mind-forged manacles I hear:*

>*How the chimney-sweeper’s cry*  
*Every black’ning church appalls,*  
*And the hapless soldier’s sigh*  
*Runs in blood down palace walls.*

>*But most through midnight streets I hear*  
*How the youthful harlot’s curse*  
*Blasts the new-born infant’s tear,*  
*And blights with plagues the marriage hearse.*
