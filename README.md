# Revision
Personal revision notes for the GCSEs I have taken. Feel free to use for yourself if it is any use.

## What happened?
Whelp. If you take a look at the site you'll find a fairly empty site, with most notes being on English. Theres a few reasons I haven't really come back to this - however I **do intend to in the near future**. Take a look below:

  * I get too distracted with things I actually enjoy - like themeing the website or creating a whole new site from scratch (My current personal site was originally made while 'revising')
  * Of course the things I spend the most time on got cut from the exam - I fell this demotivated me quite a bit as it seemed all that hard work was for nothing.
  * People began to realise other online resources were useful. A little part of me made this site as my own little silent protest as to how spending weeks writing out revision notes was so much more inconvenient and time consuming yet my version had more benefits. Being online, it can be accessed from any device, anywhere, and you don't have to worry about keeping them safe. If I somehow bricked my phone doing some stupid sh!t I usually do while being bored, who cares? I can still revise my English Poetry elsewhere. But if I got bored and made the (rather genuis in my opinion) decision to test the waterproofness of paper, my hard work will all be for nothing as I watch it deteriorate infront of my eyes. Back to the main point, people began to adopt the use of websites more rather than expecting me to bring in 5 tonnes of paper to every lesson.
  * Finally, as you can probably tell to the previous point, when its not doing something interesting, my mind.. wanders. Cool, right?
