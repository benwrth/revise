Welcome! Here you will find most of my new revision notes for the subjects I have taken for my GCSEs.

Please note this is an early project and each page takes a long time. Currently I have started with [English Literature](https://revise.wrth.me/EnLit.html) and a few small bits on other subjects.

Only half of the poetry studies are present as due to COVID-19 changes to exams, I am no longer doing the poetry topic.
